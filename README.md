This is a sandbox for projects and algorithms I'm working on to further develop skills I want to learn/master -- e.g. automation and web scraping, advanced javascript, react hooks, data structures, design patterns, and other languages or architectures of interest.

The goal is to develop pragmatic skills and to attack my weaknesses so that I can become a better engineer.
